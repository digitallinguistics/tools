## Overview

TooLiP is an online suite of tools that helps language researchers work with their data.

## General Guidelines

- Each tool is a standalone page within the website focused on helping linguists perform a single task. More complex tools should be integrated into the data management app ([Lotus]) or the data explorer portal ([Oxalis]).
- Tools should use formats and libraries from the Digital Linguistics (DLx) project.
- The site is designed to work offline. Tools should function without need for a server connection or calls to an external API (though this can happen optionally).

## Getting Started

1. Install the latest LTS version of [Node].
2. Clone this repository and navigate into its folder.

    ```cmd
    > git clone https://github.com/digitallinguistics/tools.git
    > cd tools
    ```

    If you're unfamiliar with the command line, consider installing [GitHub Desktop][gh-desktop] instead in order to sync your code with GitHub.

3. Install the software dependencies for the project.

    ```cmd
    > npm install
    ```

4. Build the app and start a local server. This will start 11ty, and rebuild the app automatically when your code changes.

    ```cmd
    > npm start
    ```

5. View your development version of the site at <http://localhost:8080>.

8. End-to-end tests are run using [Cypress]. You can run them programmatically by running `npm test` on the command line in the project root, or you can first start the server, and then (in a new command terminal) open the Cypress interface to run them manually using `npm run open-cypress`.

## Project Structure

- `.github`: GitHub configuration files
- `build`: build scripts
- `dist/`: the compiled website (not checked into git)
- `src`: the source code for the site (this is the folder processed by 11ty)
- `src/assets`: static assets such as fonts, images, etc.
- `src/classes`: global CSS classes used across the site
- `src/components`: global components (combination of an HTML partial + accompanying CSS) used across the site
- `src/layouts/main`: the main layout which serves as the app shell
- `src/layouts/main/components`: components that are only used in the app shell
- `src/layouts/main/styles`: global styles that are loaded as part of the app shell (CSS reset, typography, etc.)
- `src/tools/{tool}`: source code for individual tools
- `utilities`: JavaScript utilities
- `eslint.config.js`: contains all the settings for building the site

## Tools Structure

- `{tool-name}.html`: The HTML for the tool. (More below.)
- `{tool-name}.css`: This will be bundled and inlined automatically during build. Import all CSS dependencies for the tool into this file.
- `{tool-name}.js`: This will be bundled and inlined automatically during build. Import all JS dependencies for the tool into this file.
- `{tool-name}.test.js`: The E2E tests to run for this tool.
- `css/`: Use this subfolder for tool-specific CSS dependencies.
- `js/`: Use this subfolder for tool-specific JS dependencies.

### HTML

- Copy the Template page in `src/tools/template/template.html` when starting a new tool.
- Each tool's HTML should be wrapped in `<main class={tool-name} id=main>`.
- Each tool page needs to start with a YAML header with the following attributes:

| Property    | Format          | Description                                                         |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `permalink` | `/{tool-name}/` | The path where the tool will live. Must include the trailing slash. |
| `title`     | `{Tool Name}`   | This will appear in the browswer tab as "TooLiP \| {Tool Name}"     |

## Resources

- **[Feather Icons][Feather]:** DLx projects use Feather Icons for UI by default.

## Dependencies

- **[11ty]:** The static site generator used to build the site. Mostly useful for its layout functionality.
- **[Cypress]:** For E2E testing.
- **[esbuild]:** For bundling JS and CSS.
- **[ESLint]:** For linting JavaScript. Uses an opinionated set of style rules.
- **[flexbox-reset]:** A CSS reset that uses flexbox by default for many elements that are typically rendered as block elements.
- **[Stylelint]:** For linting CSS. Uses an opinionated set of style rules.
- **[svgstore]:** Creates SVG sprites.

**NOTE:** This project does not use either a JavaScript transpiler or a CSS preprocessor. You should only use features that are supported by the current versions of the major evergreen browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).

## DLx Dependencies

- **[design]:** Design components shared across DLx projects.
- **[eslint-config]:** An opinionated JS code style set shared across DLx projects.
- **[stylelint-config]** An opinionated CSS code style set shared across DLx projects.
- **[styles]:** CSS styles for presenting linguistic data and documents on the web.

Individual tools also use various DLx dependencies. You explore all the DLx projects [here][DLx].

## Versioning & Releases

Only update the version number when you're ready to make a release.

Development branches can be forked directly from `main`. For now there are no version branches, though there may be in the future.

Increment version numbers based on the following events.

- **major:**
  - site overhaul
  - major overhaul to a tool
  - new tool added
  - tool removed
- **minor:**
  - new functionality added
  - changes to an existing tool
- **patch:**
  - bug fixes
  - changes to development environment
  - changes to documentation
